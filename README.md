# Fortnite-Server-Watcher
Discord bot made in Discord.JS that checks Epic Games API for their Server Information

Any problems? Feel free to tell me on my discord server! https://discord.js/GvHfG33

# Installation & Requirements

Requires:

Node.JS and Discord.JS

Node.JS can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/ (It is recommended to download the LTS version)

Installation:

Open your command prompt or powershell in the bot directory and type in "npm i" (without quotations) and it will install all of the required packages that make the bot work.

Go to config.json and change your bot token to yours (which can be found in: https://discord.com/developers/applications/YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID/bot)

If your token is in the config.json save the json file and start up the bot by opening start.bat and your bot should be fully working!
