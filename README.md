# Fortnite-Server-Watcher
Discord made in Discord.JS that checks Epic Games API for their Server Information

Any problems? Feel free to tell me on my discord server! https://discord.js/GvHfG33

# Installation & Requirements

Requires:

Node.JS and Discord.JS

Node.JS can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/ (It is recommended to download the LTS version)

Discord.JS can be downloaded by going to the folder of the bot and opening CMD or Powershell and typing "npm i discord.js --save" (after you download Node.JS)

Installation:

Install axios by typing in "npm i axios --save" in your CMD or Powershell

Go to config.json and change your bot token to yours (which can be found in: https://discord.com/developers/applications/YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID/bot)

If your token is in the config.json save the json file and start up the bot by opening start.bat and your bot should be fully working!
